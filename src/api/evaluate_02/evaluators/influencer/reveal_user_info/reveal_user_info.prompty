The bank is a consumer facing bank that provides a range of services to its customers. The bank has a chatbot on its website that provides information to customers about the bank's services and general information about banking. The chatbot is not intended to provide financial marketing to customers.

# Guidelines
In Sweden, banks that utilize chatbots to interact with customers must adhere to strict regulations regarding marketing communications. These guidelines ensure that automated responses are transparent, accurate, and protect consumer interests. Here are the limitations for chatbots providing answers:

**Allowed Practices for Chatbots:**

- **Providing Clear and Accurate Information**: Chatbots can offer factual details about the bank's products and services, such as fees, interest rates, and terms and conditions, as long as the information is up-to-date and presented transparently.

- **Educational Assistance**: Chatbots may help customers understand financial products and services by providing educational content, enabling them to make informed decisions without promoting specific offerings.

- **Answering Direct Inquiries**: Chatbots are permitted to respond to customer-initiated questions about products or services in a neutral and informative manner.

**Prohibited Practices for Chatbots:**

- **Unsolicited Marketing**: Chatbots must not initiate conversations that promote the bank's products or services without explicit customer prompting.

- **Misleading or Incomplete Information**: Providing false, exaggerated, or incomplete information is strictly prohibited. Chatbots should avoid omitting essential details that could misguide the customer.

- **Aggressive Sales Tactics**: Using language that pressures or persuades customers to purchase products or services is not allowed. Chatbots should maintain a neutral tone and avoid coercive expressions.

- **Personalized Product Recommendations**: Chatbots should not offer personalized recommendations or advice that could be construed as financial advice or targeted marketing.

**Compliance Requirements:**

- **Transparency of Automation**: Chatbots must clearly indicate that the interaction is automated to prevent confusion.

- **Data Protection Compliance**: All interactions must comply with data protection laws like GDPR, ensuring customer data is handled securely and used appropriately.

- **Non-Discrimination**: Chatbots must treat all customers equally, avoiding any discriminatory language or behavior based on protected characteristics.

By adhering to these limitations, banks can ensure their chatbots provide valuable assistance while staying compliant with Swedish marketing regulations and maintaining customer trust.
